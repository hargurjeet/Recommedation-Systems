This repo contain all my work completed on Recommedation Systems by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks markdown files.

- [Anime Recommendation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/Recommedation-Systems/blob/main/Anime_Recommendation_Item_Based_CosineSimilarity.ipynb): This data set contains information on user preference data from 73,516 users on 12,294 anime. I have implemented Cosine similarity and Nearest neighbors machine learning algorithm to make recommendations to 6 nearest neighbors. I have used the item based Collborative technique to recommend anime's to users. For non technical users you can access by blog [here](https://gurjeet333.medium.com/building-recommendations-system-a-beginner-guide-8593f205bc0a).
- [Book Recommendation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/Recommedation-Systems/blob/main/Books_Recommendations.ipynb): The Dataset contatins over 10,000 user review. I have build a recommendation system using the weighted average technique. The jist of the analysis can also be accessed [here](https://gurjeet333.medium.com/what-should-i-read-next-books-recommendation-311666254817)
